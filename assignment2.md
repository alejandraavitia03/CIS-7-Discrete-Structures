1. Prove:
p -> q    <=>   q' -> p'
p' v q  <=>   q'' v p'  Implication Law
p' v q  <=>   q v p'    Double Negation 
p' v q  <=>   p' v q    Commutative
QED!

2. Prove:
(p -> r) ^ (q -> r) <=> (p v q) -> r
(p' v r) ^ (q' v r) <=> (p v q>' v r        Implication Law
(p' v r) ^ (q' v r) <=> (p' ^ q') v r       De Morgan's Law
(p' v r) ^ (q' v r) <=> (p' v r) ^ (q' v r) Distrubutive Law
QED!

3.Give an interpretation to prove that the following wff is not valid: (Ǝx)A(x) ^ (Ǝx)B(x) -> (Ǝx)(A(x) ^ B(x))
x is an edible object. 
A(x) => x is an apple
B(x) => x is a banana.
"for some x's is an apple and for some x's are banana's then for some x's are a apple and a bannana" FALSE
