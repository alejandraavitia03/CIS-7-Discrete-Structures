I really liked the video for week 5 and it was the one for induction. I wasn't really understanding the concept of it
and he took it and broke it down. I like that he used the ladder reference, because I wasn't really understanding K+1 and K. Another video is the truth tables one for week 1.
I don't know why my brain just would glitch with the if true then false, but when he spoke about negation and siad like "it takes the value
and makes it negative" that clicked in my head. Even though, it is a very simple thing.
